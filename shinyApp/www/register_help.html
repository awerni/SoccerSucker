<h2>Registration help</h2>
<p>The betting game is just for fun. Don't take it to serious. It's money free and an alternative to professional betting. The winner will get 5 minutes of fame and probably a small prize.</p>
<h3>First name</h3>
<p>Use your first name or a nickname.</p>
<h3>Surname</h3>
<p>Use your surname.</p>
<h3>Nationality</h3>
<p>Use your country of origin rather than the adjective: Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, Greece,...</p>
<h3>Expert status</h3>
<p>You are an <b>expert</b>, if you know at least three players of 3 different teams by name, if you understood the offside rule or frequently follow national or international soccer.</p>
<p>You can call yourself <b>intermediate</b> expert, if you follow soccer during world or european championships and have a basic understanding of the game. (default)</p>
<p>If you think, you are a <b>beginner</b>, you don't know much more than the number of players (11 per team) and the purpose of the game (to make more goals then the opponents).</p>
<p>Don't be too strict with yourself. Your expert status is never shown directly in the application. It is used for automated players (so called bots), to see, if experts perform better than beginners.</p>

<h2>Legal disclaimer</h2>
<p>By registering for this betting game, you agree to collect a few personal data (name, nationality, expert status, bets). A few weeks after the football tournament, your data will be deleted.</p>
